(Credit: SutronWIN)</small></p> <p><img src=\"climateland.jpg\" alt=\"\" />From the raft, the Elbow Lake station monitors ambient air temperature; relative humidity (RH); wind speed, direction and gusts; barometric pressure; and water temperature both near the surface (1.1 m depth) and 2 metres below. In addition to these climate data, the Elbow Lake station gathers water temperature data below the orange buoy at 15 depth intervals ranging from 0.25 m to 9 m, and measures dissolved oxygen at 1 m depth. Land-based gauges monitor precipitation from the adjacent shoreline, and record soil temperature 5 cm and 15 centimetres below the surface.</p> <p><img src=\"winter.jpg\" alt=\"\" />Measurements are collected frequently, enabling researchers to track changes in local climate in real-time over time intervals as short as 15 minutes. Climate data are relayed via satellite to a central server, where they are immediately available online for use by researchers worldwide! In time we will have these data available in real-time on a screen in the lodge. Data from these stations are being used to study changes in local climate and their influence on ecosystems and individual species.</p> <p><img class=\"fullwidth\" src=\"exdata.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p><small>Example air temperature data from the Elbow Lake climate station, July 2014.</small></p>",
