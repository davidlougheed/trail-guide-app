Coniferous forest, like the patch of Eastern White Cedar (<em>Thuja occidentalis<\/em>) which surrounds you now, provides valuable winter habitat for wildlife.<\/p>\r\n<p>In winter, White-tailed Deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus<\/em>) use coniferous forest as \u201cyarding areas\u201d \u2013 congregating below heavy evergreen boughs as they seek refuge from strong winds and deep snow. Although not as nutritious and digestible as their summer foods, cedar leaves also provide sustenance to deer. Two other key features of deer yards are their tendency to be located on south-facing slopes and their relative lack of human disturbance. Visitors exploring this section of trail in winter will notice numerous tracks zig-zagging in the snow providing evidence that many deer use this patch of forest as a yarding area.<\/p>",

Grouse will take advantage of the insulating properties of the snow to stay warm on cold winter nights, by burying themselves under fresh snow; doing so also helps hide them from hungry predators. Year-round, listen for the nasal \u201c<em>aaaank\u2026 aaaank\u2026 aaaank<\/em>\u201d call of the Red-breasted Nuthatch (<em>Sitta canadensis<\/em>), or chattering trill of the Red Squirrel (<em>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus<\/em>), both of which call coniferous forests home.

Timber from the forests surrounding Spectacle Lake were brought to Fishing Lake, where the small creek at the lake\u2019s southern end was diverted to accommodate 100\u2019 logs as they made their way via Loughborough Lake to the town of Battersea and beyond.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"land1878.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>Settlement of the Elbow Lake property and surrounding lands occurred through the 1870s. Many \u2013 but not all \u2013 of these settlers were members of the British Army who received grants of land after the War of 1812. The historical atlas for Frontenac County provides a snapshot of land occupation in 1878; while the rugged, sometimes cruel landscape of the Frontenac Arch proved too great a challenge for some settlers, family names such as Convery, Teepell (Teeple), and Young are present in the community to this day. Note that the 200-acre (80 ha.) parcel held by the Canada Company, bisecting the northern arm of Elbow Lake, represented one of the last remaining tracts of land in the area not yet transferred to settlers.<\/p>\r\n<p>The temporary accommodation on Spectacle Lake is estimated to have been built sometime in the 1940s, possibly by the Miller family, who owned parcels of land in Lots 4 and 5 of the 12th Concession of (the former) Storrington Township from the late 1930s until the early 1950s. By that time, the value of the surrounding forests would not have made commercial logging worthwhile, and so it perhaps most plausible that the cottage and barn provided respite for private individuals harvesting timber for personal use.<\/p>\r\n<p><small>1.

Many species give short vocalizations as they fly, possibly for echolocation (using the echo of sound waves to guide navigation), to maintain contact with other migrating birds particularly of their own kind, and to maintain spacing to avoid mid-air collisions in flight. While most of these calls take place above the average altitude of the terrain and are not easily heard by the human ear, a microphone can help tune in and amplify flight calls of migrating birds.<\/p>\r\n<p>In fall 2014, a microphone was installed at ELEEC to record the calls of birds flying over the facility. Software designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oldbird.org\/\">Old Bird Inc.<\/a>, the company of independent researcher William R. Evans of New York State, will sort out the number of calls and identify them to species. Target species are night-migrating thrushes, sparrows and warblers. The goal of the Old Bird project is to establish permanent, long-term acoustic (sound) monitoring stations continent-wide and use these to evaluate long-term trends in numbers of the focal species.<\/p>",

Initially confined to New York State, recording stations now form an acoustic monitoring transect across eastern North America and increasingly beyond. The data recorded at ELEEC will be integrated into this network, contributing to a bigger picture of bird migration throughout our region. Over the longer term, changes in migration patterns and abundances of individual bird species may be detected.<\/p>\r\n<p>At this stage of the Old Bird project, flight call data are being gathered and stored in a temporary archive of sound files. As the number of recording stations has grown, the current volume of raw data has become more than one researcher can manage and analyze, and efforts are now focused on automating the process. This will make it easier for partners to participate in the project, and will also enable studies comparing migration data both within and across monitoring sites.<\/p>\r\n<p>Following automation, the flight call data will be made available to high school students to enhance teaching and learning opportunity at ELEEC, as well as for the listening pleasure of visitors curious to know what species of birds are migrating overhead at the time of their visit.<\/p>"
