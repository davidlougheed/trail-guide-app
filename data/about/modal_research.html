    The Queen’s University Biological Station has operated its headquarters on Lake Opinicon since 1946,
    supporting an incredible number and diversity of research projects carried out on QUBS properties and
    adjacent lands. The Elbow Lake property is host to a few long-term studies, some of which are led by
    Queen’s University researchers and others that are volunteer-driven Citizen Science, but all of these
    are contributing to scientific knowledge of animal populations and their adaptations to a changing
    environment.

    While biodiversity exploration is encouraged on the Elbow Lake property, users interested in carrying
    out research are required to obtain all required permits in advance of their study. Wildlife or plant
    collection by any individual must be authorized by the appropriate agencies.
