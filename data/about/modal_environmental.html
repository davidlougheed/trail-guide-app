    The Elbow Lake property is centrally located within a unique area of the province known as the Frontenac
    Arch, characterized by a granite “bridge” connecting the Canadian Shield of the north to the Adirondack
    Mountains to the south. Here, north meets south while the limestone plains influence from the east and
    west – with the result being an incredible diversity of living things in a relatively small area. The
    Elbow Lake property helps protect that diversity in species, habitats and landscapes.

    Although by no means pristine, the Elbow Lake property has managed to remain relatively free of the
    harmful non-native species that are invading other natural areas. Learn to recognize the invasive
    aliens that have made an appearance on the property, and please
    <a href="mailto:carolyn.bonta@queensu.ca">report</a> them if found! As you will learn, some of these
    risk having serious negative effects on the natural biodiversity of the Elbow Lake property.
