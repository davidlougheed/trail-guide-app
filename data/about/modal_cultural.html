    The Elbow Lake property has been protected as a nature reserve since 2008, a designation that will
    continue in perpetuity. In the recent past, however, the terrestrial and aquatic resources of the
    property were exploited for timber, food, recreation, and human occupation. From the ground, evidence
    of human impact is presented in relatively small pieces – but to really appreciate their effects, one
    must assume a bird’s eye view. These stations tell the story of individual features from the
    perspective of their role within the broader landscape.
