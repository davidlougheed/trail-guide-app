				Welcome to the Elbow Lake Environmental Education Centre and surrounding Elbow Lake property!
				These lands are managed as a protected nature reserve by our conservation partner, the Nature
				Conservancy of Canada.  Enjoy your visit to the trails, but please abide by the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Register your intent to visit in advance by contacting the ELEEC by
					<a href="mailto:carolyn.bonta@queensu.ca">e-mail</a> or by phone at 613-353-7968.
				</li>
				<li>Do not bring any vehicles onto the property unless authorized to do so.</li>
				<li>
					Leash your pet(s) at all times while on the trails, and take responsibility by cleaning up after
					them. Pets are not allowed on the beach.
				</li>
				<li>
					Absolutely no entry in any buildings unless authorized to do so.
				</li>
				<li>
					Pack-in / pack-out all garbage.
				</li>
				<li>
					Do not intentionally disturb or remove any plant or living creature from the property.

					This <em>Elbow Lake Trail Guide</em> interpretive app was developed to introduce self-guiding
					visitors to a selection of interesting features of the Elbow Lake property, falling within three
					main themes: <a href="#" id="environment-trigger">Environmental</a>,
					<a href="#" id="cultural-trigger">Cultural</a> and
					<a href="#" id="research-trigger">Research</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each interpretive station is identified in three ways:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						By a coloured marker at the station site, stenciled to distinguish Environmental, Cultural and
						Research-themed stations;
					</li>
					<li>
						Visually overlain on the Trails Map, with a written description of the site in the app text; and
					</li>
					<li>
						Georeferenced, meaning each station is associated by its location in physical space, in this
						case by UTM coordinates in NAD83.  Each station’s coordinates are included with the app text.
						<!-- , providing an option for geocache enthusiasts to engage in virtual geocaching at ELEEC. -->
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Virtual Geocaching</h2>
				<p>
					Each interpretive station is georeferenced at the top of their respective sections in the app. Input
					these waypoints into your GPS unit, and use them to navigate precisely to each station.  Please respect
					that the Elbow Lake property is managed as a nature reserve, and remain on designated trails; as well,
					be mindful of the privacy of other guests registered to the ELEEC.
				</p>
				<p>
					At each station, take the quiz to test your knowledge about each feature of interest. This shouldn’t
					be too hard if you are at the right location, and have paid close attention and given some thought to
					the associated interpretive text. Good luck and have fun!

				The Elbow Lake property is centrally located within a unique area of the province known as the Frontenac
				Arch, characterized by a granite “bridge” connecting the Canadian Shield of the north to the Adirondack
				Mountains to the south. Here, north meets south while the limestone plains influence from the east and
				west – with the result being an incredible diversity of living things in a relatively small area. The
				Elbow Lake property helps protect that diversity in species, habitats and landscapes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although by no means pristine, the Elbow Lake property has managed to remain relatively free of the
				harmful non-native species that are invading other natural areas. Learn to recognize the invasive
				aliens that have made an appearance on the property, and please
				<a href="mailto:carolyn.bonta@queensu.ca">report</a> them if found! As you will learn, some of these
				risk having serious negative effects on the natural biodiversity of the Elbow Lake property.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="editor-only" id="cultural-content">
			<p>
				The Elbow Lake property has been protected as a nature reserve since 2008, a designation that will
				continue in perpetuity.  In the recent past, however, the terrestrial and aquatic resources of the
				property were exploited for timber, food, recreation, and human occupation.  From the ground, evidence
				of human impact is presented in relatively small pieces – but to really appreciate their effects, one
				must assume a bird’s eye view.  These stations tell the story of individual features from the
				perspective of their role within the broader landscape.

			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="editor-only" id="research-content">
			<p>
				The Queen’s University Biological Station has operated its headquarters on Lake Opinicon since 1946,
				supporting an incredible number and diversity of research projects carried out on QUBS properties and
				adjacent lands.  The Elbow Lake property is host to a few long-term studies, some of which are led by
				Queen’s University researchers and others that are volunteer-driven Citizen Science, but all of these
				are contributing to scientific knowledge of animal populations and their adaptations to a changing
				environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				While biodiversity exploration is encouraged on the Elbow Lake property, users interested in carrying
				out research are required to obtain all required permits in advance of their study.  Wildlife or plant
				collection by any individual must be authorized by the appropriate agencies.
