# Trail Guide App

**Author:** David Lougheed

I have built corresponding content editor front ends and back ends, to make it
easy for users to update content and make it accessible for a CI pipeline to
integrate the content into a binary.

Test data is used with permission from the Queen's University Biological 
Station.

## About

This is a flexible React Native + Expo app for creating a trail guide with 
interactive virtual stations that (optionally) correspond to a real world 
location.

The app functions offline (albeit with GPS connectivity), and thus has to build
in station data and assets rather than loading them from the internet.

It was originally designed for the 
[Elbow Lake Environmental Education Centre](https://elbowlakecentre.ca).
